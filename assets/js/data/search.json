A common practice is to use the contacts to request money, send messages or try to collect another sites passwords with family members. Are you a type of person who use the same password for all websites?That’s a common practice but a bad indeed, because when a site gets compromised others people now know your password and can use it on every site on internet and if you ever have account in that site they can login. Using the same password for 2 or more websites it’s not recommended.How long its a secure password?So as you probably have read it on internet, a secure password consists in “at least” 10 characters with the combination of numbers (0-9), lowercase ASCII characters (a-z), uppercase ASCII characters (A-Z) and special characters (,#$^&amp;=+]’”;.,!@/?).Minimum acceptable passwordBut a small is not acceptable with the evolution of technology, in a pair of years these passwords can be bad idea. So I must recommend to use your passwords with a least 16 characters with lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and symbols.Secure acceptable passwordBut that will be difficult to generate and remember each one of this passwords, so lets define a custom way of generate this type of passwords and you always remember it.Building unique password with you own techniqueLes begin and say most of the people include a site, date, person, animal in your passwords, and that not bad at all. Most people have a memorable site, or person, or date which never will forget and we will focus on that. So the first thing to do is to encounter a list of this “tokens” with the info you never forgot, for example the next ones: France (My first vacations!) 1Mancha$ (The name of my first pet! (one for first, $ in a replace of “s”)) 87-11 (The year, and the month on the birth date of my son) L4g00nN3wJ3rs3y (Lagoon New Jersey, but customized with numbers)You get the idea of generate these memorable places, dates, words, etc. And with that now you generate a extra information for the site you are applying the password, for example Twitter, answer the next questions an with that you can generate the unique password: What’s the use of the platform for you? (Twitts) What is the first and last letter? (TR) [always in UPPER in my example] What color it’s? (Blue) On which year are you joining? (2022)And with that for example I can generate the following passwordFranceTwitts1Mancha$TR87-11BlueL4g00nN3wJ3rs3y2022Custom secure acceptable password for twitterAnd for another site?, well answer the same questions al you get a new one secure, for example amazon. What’s the use of the platform for you? (Shopping) What is the first and last letter? (AN) [always in UPPER in my example] What color it’s? (Yellow) On which year are you joining? (2019)FranceShopping1Mancha$AN87-11YellowL4g00nN3wJ3rs3y2019Custom secure acceptable password for amazonAnd for another site?, well answer the same questions and you get a new one. Also remember to active your 2 factor authentication if its supported by the website.Even with that technique I always forgot the passwordsIf you always forgot your passwords, remember there already exists solutions like BitWarden (https://bitwarden.com/) [Recommendation, free] Lastpass (https://www.lastpass.com/) [Free but only in PC o Mobile] 1Password (https://1password.com/) [Paid, 3USD/Month approx.] Keeper (https://www.keepersecurity.com/) [Paid, 3USD/Month approx.]But I must recommend to use a second factor way using a hardware, for example security keys like Yubico. Have extra key in a safe place case of missing the principal you got another one in a safe place." } ]
